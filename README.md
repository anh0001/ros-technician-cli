# ROS Technician LLM

A Large Language Model designed specifically for ROS (Robot Operating System) technicians. This project aims to create an intelligent assistant that understands ROS architecture, debugging workflows, and robotics maintenance tasks.

## Overview

ROS Technician LLM is built to assist robotics engineers and technicians with:

- **Diagnostics & Troubleshooting** - Analyze ROS logs, identify node failures, and suggest fixes
- **System Configuration** - Help configure ROS parameters, launch files, and network setups
- **Code Understanding** - Explain ROS packages, message types, and service definitions
- **Best Practices** - Provide guidance on ROS development patterns and conventions
- **Real-time Assistance** - Interact with live ROS systems to inspect topics, services, and nodes

## Features

- Natural language interface for ROS commands
- Context-aware responses based on your robot's configuration
- Support for both ROS 1 and ROS 2
- Integration with common robotics tools and simulators
