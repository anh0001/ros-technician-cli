# ROS Technician LLM

A Large Language Model designed specifically for ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) technicians. This project aims to create an intelligent assistant that understands ROS 2 architecture, debugging workflows, and robotics maintenance tasks.

## Overview

ROS Technician LLM is built to assist robotics engineers and technicians with:

- **Diagnostics & Troubleshooting** - Analyze ROS 2 logs, identify node failures, and suggest fixes
- **System Configuration** - Help configure ROS 2 parameters, launch files, and network setups
- **Code Understanding** - Explain ROS 2 packages, message types, and service definitions
- **Best Practices** - Provide guidance on ROS 2 development patterns and conventions
- **Real-time Assistance** - Interact with live ROS 2 systems to inspect topics, services, and nodes

## Features

- Natural language interface for ROS 2 commands
- Context-aware responses based on your robot's configuration
- Integration with common robotics tools and simulators

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository and 
cd ros-technician-cli

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the assistant
python main.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- ROS 2 Humble or later
